This is a new header-only (module only in the future) Experimental library to replace iostream and cstdio based on C++ 2a feature concepts. Currently, the only compiler which supports Concepts TS is GCC. Supports VC preview as well. It can compile on clang concepts experimental. I have tested all the compilers.

It can even work on android !! 

## Documents
./doxygen/html/index.html

Since C++ 20 has not been released. No standard supporting libraries for concepts, which means a lot of Concepts Definitions are ugly. It will be changed after C++ 20 is officially published.

## Design goal.
  0. Custom Devices
  1. Exception Safe & Exception neutral
  2. As fast as possible. As close to system call as possible.
  3. Zero Overhead.
  4. As safe as possible.
  5. Binary serialization for trivially copyable types and C++ standard library containers. Serialization methods like JSON are slow and tedious for machines. read/write
  6. std::mutex mutex stream
  7. Unicode/UTF-8 support
  8. Compatible with C stdio/ C++ iostream
  9. Native Handle Interface
  10. support C style io format (fprint). Basic/Lua/Python/etc format (print, scan). NO LONGER SUPPORTS C++ style io format (<<,>>) since they are bad.
  11. Compilation time open mode parse. Supports C style open mode and C++ style open mode.
  12. No internal iomanip states (since it creates security issues)
  13. Extremely easy to support custom devices
  14. No stupid stuff like std::endl
  15. No integrated locale
  16. No traits_type and EOF shit
  17. All fast_io devices can be natively put in C++ containers. std::vector<fast_io::obuf> is valid
  18. Providing RAII for FILE*&POSIX file id
  19. Dynamic Type Support
  20. Pipe line support
  21. Zero copy IO
  22. Cryptography (Under construction) to replace openssl

## Future Plan After C++ 20
  1. Module support
  2. Coroutine support for async IO
  3. if this proposal would be released. Probably remove more stuffs here
     Zero-overhead deterministic exceptions: Throwing values
     http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0709r0.pdf
  4. Network handle support with coroutine. (NOT ASIO library)
     NETWORK SUPPORT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT IN MODERN WORLD
  5. Partial Freestanding mode

## Possible Stuff in the future
  1. Compression/Decompression
  2. Interfaces for cloud computing algorithms like MapReduce

I want this to be in the C++ standard library in the future. :)

## How to use this library? 
Please see examples in the examples folder.

compile option:
    
	g++ -o example example.cc -O2 -std=c++2a -fconcepts

Updated benchmark with trunk gcc

I did some optimizations to my fast_io library. Now there is NO reason to use charconv any more. It is insecure and the APIs are terrible. I hope isocpp would deprecate charconv in the future.
