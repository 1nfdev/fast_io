This is a new Experimental library to replace iostream and cstdio based on C++ 2a feature concepts. Currently, the only compiler which supports Concepts TS is GCC.

Since C++ 20 has not been released. No standard supporting libraries for concepts, which means a lot of Concepts Definitions are ugly. It will be changed after C++ 20 is officially published.

Design goal.

1. Exception Safe & Exception neutral
2. As fast as possible. As close to system call as possible.
3. Zero Overhead.
4. As safe as possible.
5. Binary serialization for trivially copyable types and C++ standard library containers. Serialization methods like JSON are slow and tedious for machines. read/write
6. Native mutex support
7. Native Unicode/UTF-8 support
8. Compatible with C stdio/ C++ iostream
9. Native Handle Interface
10. support C style io format (fprint). C++ style io format (<<,>>). Basic/Lua/Python/etc format (print, scan)
11. Compilation time open mode parse. Supports C style open mode and C++ style open mode.
12. No internal iomanip states (since it creates security issues)
13. Extremely easy to support custom devices
14. No stupid stuff like std::endl
15. No integrated locale
16. No traits_type and EOF shit
17. All fast_io devices can be natively put in C++ containers. std::vector<fast_io::obuf> is valid
18. Providing RAII for FILE*&POSIX file id
19. Dynamic Type Support

Future Plan After C++ 20
1. Module support
2. Coroutine support for async IO
3. if this proposal would be released. Probably remove more stuffs here
Zero-overhead deterministic exceptions: Throwing values

4. Network handle support with coroutine. (NOT ASIO library)
NETWORK SUPPORT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT IN MODERN WORLD

Possible Stuff in the future
1. Cryptography
2. Compression/Decompression

I want this to be in the C++ standard library in the future. :)

How to use this library? Please see examples in the examples folder.

compile option:
g++ -o example example.cc -O2 -std=c++17 -fconcepts
